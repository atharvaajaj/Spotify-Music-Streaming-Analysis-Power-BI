# Spotify Music Streaming Analysis | Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze Spotify Top 50 music data.  
The goal is to help music analysts, playlist curators, and marketing teams understand **song popularity trends, artist performance, album distribution, and listener behavior** across time.

The dashboard converts raw ranking-based data into meaningful insights for business decision-making.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Spotify’s raw “Top 50” dataset provides rankings but lacks analytical depth. Stakeholders face challenges such as:
- No centralized KPI monitoring
- Limited visibility into popularity trends
- Difficulty comparing explicit vs non-explicit content
- No clear view of album vs single performance
- Lack of drill-down from overview to artist and song level

This project addresses these gaps using an interactive Power BI solution.
